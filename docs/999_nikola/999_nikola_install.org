* First post on Nikola
Thanks and comments on how to install static website generator. [[https://streakycobra.github.io/posts/blogging-in-org-mode-with-nikola/][Blogging in Org Mode With Nikola]]

* Modify Python File for org Mode

when this was mentionned

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Add the orgmode compiler to your COMPILERS dict.
COMPILERS["orgmode"] = ('.org',)

# Add org files to your POSTS, PAGES
POSTS = POSTS + (("posts/*.org", "posts", "post.tmpl"),)
PAGES = PAGES + (("stories/*.org", "stories", "story.tmpl"),)
#+END_SRC

I thought that it was about things in the emacs file. Finally it was
about things in the conf.py file. So search the posts and search the
compilers and add them into the conf.py file. Don't forget to commit.

* Error about system language

** Error happened when this command :
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nikola new_post 999_nikola_install.org
